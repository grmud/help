 Founding Grumbles, Clans, and Lairs 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 <b> Command to found a clan: FOUND CLAN</b> 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 <b> Command to found a lair: FOUND LAIR</b> 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 A grumble is nothing more than a loose association of monsters. A grumble does not need to be founded. Members are added to a grumble simply by being invited by a current grumble member and then accepting that member's invitation. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 A clan can only be founded by a leader. There are some pre-requisites that must be met for a clan to be founded. A leader who wishes to form a clan must have at least five minions in his or her grumble. These minions must all be of the same caste as the leader, unless the leader is a diplomat. Once this is done, the leader can then type 'found clan' to found the clan. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 To found a lair the leader must have ten minions. At least three minions must have the builder role and at least one minion with the shaman role. Only a builder may found a lair. The builder must be a member of a previously founded clan, and the leader of that clan must be in the same location as the builder. If the clan's leader also has the builder role, the clan leader may found a lair without aid from other clan members. Once a suitable spot has been decided upon for a lair, the builder may type 'found lair' to found the lair.<br/>
