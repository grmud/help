<h3>Hoarding</h3>
 
<p>
 Social monsters are able to hoard resources and item in their storage rooms to show off their wealth and money, thus increasing their <a href="help_social_clans_infamy.html">infamy</a>. Hoarding resources is also necessary because the cost of keeping a lair refurbished and in good repair is expensive along with making sure a clan is well-paid and rewarded for their efforts. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 To acquire a clan hoard, you must first join a clan and build a clan lair. If you have a lair, then your clan must build a storage chamber to collect and store their hoard. Once you have a storage chamber you can add to the overall clan hoard in several ways: 
</p><ul>

<li> <i>drop &lt;amount&gt; &lt;resource&gt;</i> -- If you are standing within a <a href="help_structures_storage_chamber.html">storage chamber</a>, you can drop a specified amount of resources, which will form a pile of loot on the floor or add to the loot that is currently there.
</li><li> <a href="help_lairs_mining.html">Mining</a> -- If you find a resource deposit, and your clan miner builds a mine, builders can order grunts to mine the resource and your grunts will automatically deposit the mined resources into the clan hoard.
</li><li> <i>deposit &lt;item&gt;</i> -- If you are standing within a <a href="help_structures_storage_chamber.html">storage chamber</a>, you can deposit an item into the hoard which converts that item into a resource.
</li></ul>
 
<p>
 To find out how many resources you have hoarded: 
</p><ul>

<li> <i>look pile of loot</i> -- If you are standing within a <a href="help_structures_storage_chamber.html">storage chamber</a>, you can check how many resources are stored in that chamber by looking at the loot pile.
</li><li> <i>resource</i> -- By typing this command a pop up window will display showing you how many total resources your clan has hoarded, how many personal resources you have hoarded, and the amount of resources you are carrying
</li></ul>
 
<p>
 Despite monsters insatiable desire to hoard resources all to themselves, the hoard will often be depleted for various reasons: 
</p><ul>

<li> <a href="help_gameplay_adventurers.html">Adventurers</a> love to loot hoards and kill monsters, that is their sole purpose in life and they will never cease trying.
</li><li> <i>get &lt;amount&gt; &lt;resource&gt; from pile of loot</i> -- Monsters are greedy. They want all the resources for themselves, so they will often take them from each other. If you wish to raid another clan and carry away their resources, just take it from the pile of loot in their storage chamber.
</li><li> <a href="help_lairs_maintenance.html">Maintenance costs</a> -- When you build structures within your clan, your clan must pay the maintenance costs to maintain those structures, otherwise they will crumble and fall to the ground.
</li><li> <a href="help_clans_upkeep.html">Minion upkeep costs</a> -- Minions are not happy unless they have their own hoards to maintain and resources to carry around. Therefore, if you are the leader of a clan, all funds you use to pay upkeep on your minions will be taken from the clan hoard.
</li></ul>
