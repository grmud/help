 </p><h3> Humanoid</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 The members of the Humanoid caste are typified by a strong connection to the Earth, to deep, dark places--soil and dirt and rock, primal slime and volcanic fire. They are the denizens of an entire underground world that most surface dwellers will never see a tenth of. They are solid as the earth, for the most part, and as strong. They think and make decisions with the careful slow progress of one tectonic plate grinding over eons against another, giving rise to the view that they are stupid. They are not necessarily so ... more than one hapless pink-skin traveler has been caught neatly in a trap planned with a cunning cleverness. The humanoid caste is stubborn, fierce and brave to the point of foolhardiness, and for some their tempers may run away with them, leading them into a berserk killing frenzy. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Humanoid monsters love the fruits of their deep earth; gold and gems mined from her very bones, minerals and fungi. They compete fiercely with each other for the limited resources available, and strike with great delight at the recent surface-world invaders ... the pink-skinned humans. Members of this caste quickly learned that, besides having tender, sweet flesh that was especially delicious if its owner was still shrieking, pink skins also carried items of worth to themselves. Humanoids form clans to hunt these sweet treats on a frequent basis, though squabbles over the choicest bits of flesh are liable to break out at any feast. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 These underground dwellers have keen senses of smell, and indeed, odors and smells are very important to them, telling them a vast amount of information about colleagues and enemies with a simple sniff. A very strong, eye-watering stench is much admired among the humanoid caste, and tales are told in awed voices of the last truly awful-smelling female orc, a lady so beautifully smelly she could knock male orcs down at fifty paces. Humanoid monsters also have keen night vision, though this is somewhat of a liability near a large fire or under the bright glare of the sun. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 In appearance, those of the humanoid caste tend to have rough skin with dirt ground into it, or else be covered by thick, matted pelts. They are the colors of the deep earth; greys and browns and blacks, with a few albinos and fire-colored denizens. Their features tend to be heavy, with thick, strong bones, sharp teeth, and thick claws. Most of them tend to be shorter in height, though the more powerful denizens are proportionately taller and even more muscular. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Humanoids revere Grendel as their god, acknowledging him as the one who taught them to fight, who taught them that pink-skins were the best hunting. They admire his brute strength and power, his ability to crush all who stand before him. They love him because his smell is the smell of the deep earth, of the primordial dirt and ooze from which they sprang. They strive to be like him in these things, emulating him as their hero. They offer live sacrifices as well as burnt offerings after each battle, teasing and tormenting their captives to make them scream, for this is said to be the music Grendel loves best. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 The members of the humanoid caste prefer burrows of their own making, hidden deep within the embracing earth, or else natural caves and crevices not easily reached by humans. Their earthy lairs are often warm and damp, rich with myriad smells and sounds and everyday comforts like bubbling slime pits and rivers of lava. There may be small firepits here and there, but these underground dwellers have good night vision and keen senses of smell, and so they leave their lairs mostly dark, which can be deadly to any pink-skin hunters foolish enough to venture in.

</p><blockquote><i>"..crush and crack and crush and crack,
<br/> suck the marrow, sip the fat.
<br/> Pink-skins sweet, their skins all crispy,
<br/> Screaming, crying, begging mercy.
<br/> Take a bite, no be shy,
<br/> Chew em up, watch em die."
<br/></i> 
<blockquote>--Gruzig Bonekrusher(Orc) from "Gruzig's Eat Song"</blockquote> </blockquote><br/>
