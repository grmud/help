 </p><h3>Mummy</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 Mummies are excellent examples of dogged determination and long-term planning. As living beings desiring immortality, at death they had themsleves bound in layers of finely woven linen, special ceremonial oils, unguents and preservatives, and often tiny treasures of carved gemstones, gold, and silver. The inner layers of their wrappings were inscribed in sacred inks with row upon row of ritual incantations, prayers, and exhortations to the powers of life and death. And, after eons, their patience was rewarded. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Mummies continue into the afterlife with the same persistence, patience, and dedication they started the whole process with. They make nearly unstoppable soldiers as piercing, slicing, and crushing does little to damage their dessicated bodies. They also make excellent builders, patiently maneuvering building materials into precise place or ritually aligning structures so the favor of the universe falls upon them. Surprisingly they can make good leaders as well, although their skills lie in manipulation of minds rather than snapping out direct orders.

</p><p>
 In appearance mummies are dessicated humanoid forms concealed in layers of dusty strips of cloth. They have a habit of leaving trails of dust and sand when they walk. They are sometimes difficult to understand in conversation because they tend to exhale dust and sand when talking. Their movements are shuffling and slow, but unwavering. 
</p><p>
 Mummies are vulnerable to fire and fear it greatly, because their bodies and wrappings are dust-dry and often layered in flammable oils.
