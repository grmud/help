 </p><h3>Vampire</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 Vampires can be the most beautiful and vain of all the undead, should they choose to be so. They are able to maintain their bodies in a close appearance of actual life by draining the life force of their victims. The strongest source of this life essence is the victim's blood, fairly ambrosia to a hungry vampire. Vampires regenerate quickly with a ready supply of blood, making them naturals at healing. They are also skilled at healing others, should they choose to bestow this gift. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Vampires are cool and rational thinkers with a keen sense of order; indeed, more than one has been accused of being a "neat-freak" by other less-than-organized undead. Many vampires have their portraits painted for posterity, being lineage-minded and taking great pride in belonging to an old and important undead family. Anyone looking at these portraits might find one common theme among the myriad of different coldly beautiful faces; a disdainful smirk or look of disgusted boredom. Vampires are aristocrats, even if only in their own minds, and wear an aura of dignity and entitlement like a royal cloak about them.

 In appearance vampires are like pale marble statues. Their skin is smooth and cold and hard, utterly perfect, with a faint sheen to it. They retain the form of their formerly living body, but the vampire's dark glamour enhances the features into a cold stunning beauty. Their movements are graceful and studied, but they can be quick as striking snakes if the mood suits them. They have long white canines used for drinking blood, and may have well-kept claws as well. They often use their mesmerizing beauty to cloud the minds of their prey and draw them closer. Rare tales are told of those vampires who care nothing for their appearance and choose to be hideous. Vampires do not emit a stench of overpowering rot like most other undead, but the faint copper tang of blood always surrounds them.
