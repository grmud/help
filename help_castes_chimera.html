 </p><h3>Chimera</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 The Chimera Caste differs greatly from the other two monster castes in that they alone are the monsters who do not suffer from the bright rays of the daytime sun. Sun, in fact, reveals them in all their glory; jeweled scales, brilliant iridescent feathers, sleek, shining fur. Their beauty, awesome in its power, nevertheless does not hide their terrible curving claws, gleaming fangs, and muscular bodies. Their beauty is a deadly one, terrible and awe-inspiring to behold. Chimeras are creatures of Nature and enjoy the freedom of roaming the land and skies, doing as they will. They are capricious in nature, with mercurial moods and interests. Quickly bored, they can be mercilessly cruel to those weaker than they, many of them taking great joy in playing with their prey.

 The advent of humans was a rude shock to their sensibilities; how dare the pink-skins chop down their trees, dam their rivers, scale their mountains! Even worse, the pink-skins had a habit of stealing their bright-pretty-shiny things, collected over centuries of existence. Besides all of which, they stunk to the skies. Such ugly, cantankerous, puny little soft creatures could not be allowed to live if they were going to destroy the land, the waters, and the skies. Usually solitary creatures, some chimeras saw the value in banding together to destroy this annoyance, and those with greater intelligence direct the efforts of their brethren against the human invaders.

 In appearance, the chimeras vary greatly, but nearly all are beautiful in a bestial way. They are vain of their appearance and take pains to keep themselves glorious looking. As the chimera are also the only monsters who cannot readily use tools, this involves much rolling in sand, snow, or water, and sometimes mutual grooming, to keep their scales, feathers and fur in top condition.

</p><p>
 The Chimera caste respect Grendel as the first of them to strike against the enemy destroying the land, as a force of Nature in his own right. Some of them have been known to cry, "For Grendel!" in their own tongues as they attack from above, striking terror into the hearts of pink-skins. The Chimera are primarily beasts and as such do not have organized rituals or worship. Their temples are the earth and the sky, and their worship is the exercise of their freedom and the power within them.

</p><p>
 The Chimera caste prefers remote places for lairs deep volcanic crevices, unscalable mountain peaks, and burrows beneath nearly bottomless lakes in the centers of swamps. They value the display of merciless nature right at their doorsteps and revel in the fact that they are part of this primal force. Remote lairs often allow them to easily detect approaching pink-skin hunters as well, and prepare to defend what is theirs.

</p><blockquote> <i>"...and in my younger days we hunted the pink-skins in their false metal skins, for it was great sport to use just enough flame to turn the metal skins red-hot, yet not burn anything else of them. If you burned the pink skin or the fur on their heads you were known to be clumsy and without grace or skill. If, however, you could turn the metal skins red-hot as a fiery cherry, and make the pink-skins dance and scream in frantic circles while the heat of their own metal skins roasted them alive, why then, you were a crack shot and worthy of much glory. Not to mention extra thigh bones at feast-time." </i>
