 </p><h3>Lich</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 Liches are the very embodiment of willpower, or perhaps sheer undiluted stubbornness. Fierce in their drive for power, their undying spirit keeps the rotted forms of their former bodies together against the laws of nature. In their living years, they were often powerful wizards, sorcerors or alchemists who, once their time came, simply could not let go of the power they had accumulated. Passing through death, they discovered a new phase of existence in immortal if eternally decaying bodies, and with hardly the bat of an eyelid continued their schemes. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Liches are natural leaders; they radiate power and demand nothing less than total subservience from their minions. Their minds are keen and always hungry for new knowledge. They are the scholars of the undead, preferring ritual chambers and dusty tomes and deep silence to chasing pink-skins through a dark forest at night. Liches can exhibit a deep and savage fury, however, if disturbed by intruders. They are also more than capable of dealing out their fair share of death to the living. But for the most part liches prefer to work through minions so they don't have to work up a sweat with what they consider menial tasks. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 In appearance liches are emaciated, often badly rotted humanoid forms. They are noted for the piercing intensity of their eyes. Liches are often so focused on their goals and ambitions that their appearances fall by the wayside. What they lack in body they more than make up for in presence. The aura of power around a lich is uncomfortably strong, demanding obedience and respect and generating terror in living beings. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Liches are vulnerable to magic, that which in life gave them such power. Normal weapons will do little against them except make them angry. 
</p><p>
