<p>
 When you create a monster, you must pick a role that you want to play. The role determines your social interaction within the game, by limiting the special abilities available to your monster, but also by provides additional specialization in an area of the game. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Selecting Two Roles (Social Monsters Only) 
</p><p>
 When you choose a role, you have the option to choose one or two roles for your character (wandering monsters are only allowed to choose one). If you limit your monster only to a single role, then you will also have access to a handful of special abilities that other "hybrid" monsters (monsters with two roles) will not. Hybrid monsters will have more special ability choices, but find themselves more constrained in their special ability selection by the special ability slot limitations. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 When you choose the first role, you will also be forced to choose a subtype of that role. Subtypes of roles give special bonuses to monsters for certain activities allowing them to specialize further in their field (e.g. a Trapper gains bonuses for trap activities, or a Diplomat may have members from a different caste in his immediate grumble.
