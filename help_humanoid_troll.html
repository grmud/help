 </p><h3>Troll</h3>
 
<br/> 
<br/> Trolls are secretive creatures of the deep earth, seldom seen on the surface of the world. Trolls are driven by their hunger, which is insatiable, and spend much time catching and eating tender-fleshed pink-skins and other creatures. They prefer to lie in wait and spring upon unsuspecting prey, and may be surprisingly patient in this regard. Much of their culture is constructed around the ritual feast, and to a troll nothing is more beautiful than a fresh, bloody thigh-bone. Troll language and expression reflects this devotion to food; they have many words for eating and feasting, and many songs and stories feature at least one feast somewhere in the text, complete with detailed descriptions of the food. 
<br/> 
<br/> Trolls have a special affinity for the earth; they are attuned to its rhythms and understand its nature. This special connection confers upon them the regenerative capabilities of the earth. Trolls heal much faster than other humanoids and have a knack for the healing arts. They dislike those who hurt the earth, tearing it up clumsily or removing and carrying away its treasures. 
<br/> 
<br/> In appearance, trolls are thin, ugly creatures covered with a thin layer of fur. Since they reside in the dark depths of the earth they have large, sensitive eyes and large ears to detect the movement of prey. They may remain still for long periods of time, but when they spring they are fast and strong, rarely letting prey escape them. 
<br/> 
<br/> Trolls hate and are vulnerable to fire, for it singes their delicate skin and fur and hurts their eyes.
