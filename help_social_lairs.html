 Lairs are the dwellings of social monster clans. They are composed of a dynamic set of functional rooms that are almost always underground in "Dungeon" or "Burrow" form. Social monsters characters with the builder role are able to extend their clan lair by using their special abilities to add new <i>structures</i> to their lair. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 A structure is a single room or space in a clan's lair. Structures provide economic and combat benefits -- providing special functions to the entire clan, like individual monster hordes, increased healing rates, increasing resource storage, providing defense benefits and a structure's integrity can can be "powered-up" through the application of favors by individual clan members. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Structures have certain building prerequisites, such as a spending a certain number of resources, or requires the presence of a certain role, or another structure. Also, once a structure is built, there is a cost to maintain that particular structure, necessitated by surrounding structures a or a period clan resource deduction. If that maintenance cost is not met, then the structure will degrade over time, losing hitpoints and functionality until it either crumbles to the ground or its maintenance cost is met. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 To build a structure, you will need to have the builder role and at least one grunt that you command. To initate building enter this command: 
</p><blockquote><i>build &lt;structure name&gt; to the &lt;direction&gt;</i> </blockquote> 
<br/> Once you do this, all the grunts that are following you will start building the structure. As an a beginning builder it may take a long time for them to build a structure, so be patient. The more grunts you have assigned to the task, the faster it will go.
