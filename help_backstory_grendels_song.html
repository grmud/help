<blockquote> 
<p>
 There was a time when I was alone and unmolested 
</p><p>
 In my dark hidey-hole 
</p><p>
 There I fought and contested 
</p><p>
 With the earthworm and the mighty mole 
</p><p>
 But slowly sounds they came from above 
</p><p>
 Of picks a-picking and diggers a-digging 
</p><p>
 Horribly and with a most unwelcome shove 
</p><p>
 A sunbeam burst through my earthwork rigging! 
</p><p>
 The smell of fresh air was all around me 
</p><p>
 The worst smell Id ever known 
</p><p>
 And when it got dark enough for me to see 
</p><p>
 I saw the wretched things that they had sown 
</p><p>
 They planted corn in my roof, me lads! 
</p><p>
 They put out their cows a-grazing. 
</p><p>
 The rudeness of these uncouth cads 
</p><p>
 Was enough to set my blood a-blazing 
</p><p>
 So I came to them, to ask them please 
</p><p>
 To leave a poor old monster alone 
</p><p>
 Remove this light from which the earthworm flees 
</p><p>
 And that makes the mighty mole mirthless moan 
</p><p>
 But they screamed at me, in their mead-hall 
</p><p>
 Pretended to not understand my words 
</p><p>
 They lifted axes in the air, looking for a brawl 
</p><p>
 They only replied with their cutting swords 
</p><p>
 If its a fight you want, its a fight youll get 
</p><p>
 I sadly spoke into their faces 
</p><p>
 Their bones were fragile; their blood was wet 
</p><p>
 And they were fun to catch in chases 
</p><p>
 I grew to delight in their torment 
</p><p>
 In making red their skins of pink 
</p><p>
 But I was never able to remove that scent 
</p><p>
 That horrible human stink 
</p><p>
 Well this went on for many many years 
</p><p>
 It really was the greatest fun 
</p><p>
 I laughed so hard I couln't count the tears 
</p><p>
 I swore that Id never be done. 
</p><p>
 
<br/> And then from across the seas I heard the horns report 
</p><p>
 A hero landed on the shores: one ugly, fat, and short 
</p><p>
 The pathetic pink-skins called him Beowulf 
</p><p>
 I knew Id eat him soon enough 
</p><p>
 I stepped into that mead hall again, as I did each and every night 
</p><p>
 Not expecting this boasting braggart rat to put up any sort of fight 
</p><p>
 I give him credit; He was awake while all the others slept 
</p><p>
 But curiously while others dreamed, he sat there and he wept 
</p><p>
 I almost felt sorry for this sad sack of flesh, for I had known sadness too 
</p><p>
 I decided to see if there was something that I could do 
</p><p>
 I whispered words on gentle winds while I hid in darkness: 
</p><p>
 "Beowulf, what is wrong, why the teary distress?" 
</p><p>
 Mistaking me for the courts harp-player he began to spill his guts 
</p><p>
 (Something that I knew about having done it to others lots) 
</p><p>
 "There is a horrible evil Ive been sent to this place to cleanse." 
</p><p>
 "But - I dont want to kill the monster, I only want to be friends." 
</p><p>
 Well, this is something that struck me very close to my heart. 
</p><p>
 I had wanted only friendship from the start. 
</p><p>
 "Beowulf," I spoke again, louder now as I walked near. 
</p><p>
 "I am the monster Grendel, and I will be your friend right here." 
</p><p>
 His face looked up at mine and smiled; I saw a sparkle in his eye 
</p><p>
 I walked over and gave him a great big hug just to say, "Hi." 
</p><p>
 But Beowulf beguiled me, tricked me with his charm 
</p><p>
 He kicked me in the groin and then ripped off my arm! 
</p><p>
 Howling, howling, I ran to escape 
</p><p>
 My blood spurting and my mind agape! 
</p><p>
 (I can understand why he wanted to cause me harm, 
</p><p>
 but what in the world would he want with my arm?) 
</p><p>
 They thought I was dead, but I made my way out 
</p><p>
 I hid deep underground, off any main route. 
</p><p>
 
<br/> There for many a decade I did lay 
</p><p>
 Again with the earthworm and mole I did play 
</p><p>
 Until I heard that they had come to this place; that they had come here! 
</p><p>
 To an island and land that I hold most dear 
</p><p>
 The island of Uthgol, the home of my kin 
</p><p>
 That pink-skins had come here was surely a sin 
</p><p>
 I heard they were planting their corn and grazing their cows 
</p><p>
 I heard they were constructing another great Mead-house! 
</p><p>
 So now I come to aid and I come with great strength 
</p><p>
 Ive been underground for such a great length 
</p><p>
 That my power has grown, and my size has increased 
</p><p>
 And I will not leave until the pink-skins have ceased 
</p><p>
 This will be my never ever ending task 
</p><p>
 I will not let any of my children come to harm 
</p><p>
 Only one thing that of you I ask - 
</p><p>
 Can one of you, please find my arm? </p></blockquote><br/>
