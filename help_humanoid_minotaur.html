 </p><h3>Minotaur</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 Minotaurs are mysterious creatures even to others of the humanoid caste. They have an air of deep, ancient dignity about them that commands respect. They are wise and able leaders with strong senses of justice and order. They make formidable warriors and often lead their soldiers into battle, bellowing fearsome war cries. Minotaurs often start out cool and collected warriors, but a battle that is not going well may inflame their tempers, turning them into enraged beasts. Then a minotaur is likely to trample friend and foe alike in a frenzy of bloodlust. Minotaurs also make excellent builders, and have a particular affinity for mazes. They have an innate sense of direction that allows them to never get lost in mazes. They are quite adept at and enjoy hunting down other races who venture into their mazes. Minotaurs hate to be teased and have little if any sense of humor. Honor, pride, and dignity weigh heavily with them. Their society is woven of so many codes of etiquette and conduct, outsiders often blunder when trying to understand them and end up being attacked or eaten for imagined slights and insults.

 Minotaurs have formal rituals for every aspect of life, and one might think this stifling. Yet if outsiders were to be granted access to the innermost circles of minotaur society they would see an earthy, pleasure-loving race who bind themselves in ritual in order to rise above the lesser beasts. Minotaurs value wisdom and clear thinking in harmony with and rule over their bestial instincts.

 In appearance, minotaurs are large, heavily muscled creatures that look like humans with the heads of bulls. Males may top eight feet while females easily reach seven. They have glossy, well-groomed hides covered with short fur. Their manes are cropped short and stand up in a stiff crest from the tops of their heads down their necks. Both sexes bear large curving horns, and the decoration of these is the center of much ritual in minotaur society. The horns may be banded in bronze, silver, or gold, enameled, carefully engraved or inlaid, draped with fine chains and polished. Each decoration is carefully chosen and each tells something of its wearer. Every young minotaur, upon attaining adulthood, has its horns banded at the base in simple unadorned bronze. Minotaurs move with a stately grace and deadly quickness.
