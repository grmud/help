<h3> Wandering Monsters</h3>
 
<p>
 As a wandering monster, your main purpose is to roam about terrorizing fellow monsters and uglies. You are nomadic and you live to hoard resources for yourself. As a wandering monster you are limited on the role you can have, to either <a href="help_social_roles_magical.html">magical</a> or <a href="help_social_roles_warrior.html">warrior</a> (<i>Note: Due to the limitations on their caste, Humanoids can only be warriors, Chimera can only be Magical, and Undead can be either</i>). You also have the unique ability to evolve into different, and better monsters. As you prove yourself to Grendel, he grants you the ability to reincarnate into a greater creatures. You do this by gaining <a href="help_gameplay_favor.html">favors</a> from various activities like hoarding resources, attacking lost adventurers, and being a general nuisance. You can then take your earned favors and spend them to increase attributes, special ability ranks, or trade them for karma points. 
</p><p>
 You use karma differently than social monsters. When you have accumulated enough karma, you can choose to reincarnate as a different type of monster when you die. There are seven tiers of monsters that a wandering monster can reincarnate into, each progressively more capable than the previous tier. However, each tier puts a cap on you monster's attributes and abilities. That cap will increase as you reicarnate allowing you to become more powerful. Reincarnating as a new type of creature involves losing your special abilities and attribute upgrades, though you do start with the new inherent abilities, as well as bonus favors.
