 </p><h3>Orc</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 Orcs are perhaps the best known of the humanoid caste, being numerous and inclined to form large clans. Always loud and boisterous, orcs nevertheless adhere to a strict hierarchy within their ranks. Although not always respectful of leadership, they know when to keep their mouths shut and follow orders. Orcs are more inclined to follow leaders who promise and deliver a high level of carnage and loot. As long as there is battle, treasure and loot, an orc will follow its leader anywhere, even to the surface world. Should a leader's luck falter, his orc soldiers are likely to mutiny and desert or kill him. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Orcs are not deep or strong thinkers and are not much given to philosophical musings about the nature of the world and their place in it. They are physically oriented creatures who live in the present from meal to meal and battle to battle. They are possessed of a certain sly cunning and more than a little vindictiveness. They make excellent foot soldiers and builders. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Orcs have their own strange code of battlefield honor among their own clans, but this same honor does not apply to humans or other castes. They have a surprisingly rich oral tradition which consists mainly of battle chants and themes on torture and food. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 In appearance, orcs are short, squat humanoids with stooped postures. Their muscular arms hang low to the ground, knuckles nearly brushing the earth. They are wiry and tough, exhibiting coiled energy and strength. They have scaly skin, pointed ears, and broad mouths. They usually also have a strong smell about themselves, and orcs with the strongest reek may be much respected by others.
