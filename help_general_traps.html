<h3>Traps</h3>
 
<p>
In order to build a trap, you must be a builder with the Basic Traps special ability. You may then set your choice of traps in your lair. To set a trap, type, <i>set &lt; opening|item|here &gt; [ with ] &lt; trap name &gt;</i>. To add more charges to the traps you set, type, <i>charge &lt; opening|item|here &gt; &lt; number of charges &gt;</i>. To see a list of traps you can set, type: <i>traplist</i>. To disarm traps, type: <i>disarm &lt;here|direction|portal|item&gt;</i>. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Traps may be set on items within your lair, on structures in your lair, or on portals (the doors between structures). Some traps can only be set on objects, some only on rooms, and some only on portals. Other traps are more versatile, and can be set on all of the above. 
</p><p>
Each trap requires a certain amount of resources to create. When a builder kills or damages someone with a trap, the builder will gain favor points. 
</p><p>
The following traps are available to builders with the Basic Traps special ability: 
</p><ul>

<li><b>Poison Needle</b>: The builder traps an object with a needle which stabs the target, doing a small amount of damage and poisoning the target.
</li><li><b>Snare Trap</b>: The monster hides a rope in the ground, which snakes around the leg of the target, whipping him up into the air and holding him immobile for a period of time.
</li><li><b>Falling Rocks</b>: The builder rigs a pile of rocks in the ceiling. When the trap is triggered, the rocks fall onto to the target's head.
</li><li><b>Impaler</b>: Builder sets a trap on an object, room, or portal. When the trap is triggered, the target is impaled by a large spear.
</li><li><b>Head Knocker</b>: The builder rigs a trap with a large club which will swing out and hit the target who triggers it.
</li><li><b>Claw Slasher</b>: The builder rigs a set of metal claws on an object so that when the trap is triggered, the target is slashed with them.
</li><li><b>Jaws of Death</b>: The Jaws of Death are giant metal teeth built into a portal. When the trap is triggered, the jaws slam shut, biting down on the target.
</li><li><b>Axe Pendulum</b>: The builder attaches a giant axe on a chain to the ceiling. When the trap is triggered, the pendulum swings, and the target is hit by the axe.
</li><li><b>Trumpet Gun</b>: The trumpet gun fires a collection of rocks, broken glass, nails, and other various small, unpleasant objects.
</li><li><b>Slice and Dice</b>: The trap extends a metal arm outfitted with a variety of rotating cutting implements to slice and dice any intruder entering the room.
</li><li><b>Swinging Log</b>: The builder rigs a large log in the ceiling of a room or portal. When the target triggers the attack, it is hit by the log and takes blunt damage. Additionally the target may be knocked back into the room it came from.
</li><li><b>Little Bang/Big Bang/Room Kaboom</b>: The builder places a quantity of explosives, which when triggered explode the target and possible those near it. The little bang trap will only target an individual. Big Bang will target all in the room. Room Kaboom should be considered to be very dangerous and it is very possible the explosion will damage the structure it is in. Caution should be exercised while using it.
</li></ul>
