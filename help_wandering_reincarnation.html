<h3> Reincarnation</h3>
 
<p>
 <tt>Usage: changeform</tt> -- While you are dead, use this command to find out the requirements you must meet to reincarnate. 
</p><p>
 As a wandering monster, you have the ability to reincarnate into more powerful creatures with greater and more abilities. There are seven tiers of monsters to which you can reincarnate. Each tier represents the level of ability and power your wandering monster has achieved. 
</p><p>
 As a wandering monster you may reincarnate either downwards (towards a weaker monster type), or upwards (towards more powerful monster types). Reincarnating downwards requires only that karma be spent. To reincarnate upwards in a tier, you must reach a minimum level and spend the appropriate amount of karma. Once you are dead, and have enough karma to reincarnate, type CHANGEFORM to open the changeform window, and select from the monster races that you can reincarnate to. 
</p><p>
 When you reincarnate as a new monster, your attributes and abilities will be modified, however, you will gain a large amount of free favors to spend at your discretion (such as raising attributes, abilities, or buying karma)! . For the most part, your attributes will be reduced, but you always have the option of spending your free favor points to raise them back up. 
</p><p>
 Reincarnating into new monster forms has other advantages. As you traverse upwards on the wandering monster tiers, your monster will become larger. Certain special abilities are also only available to larger monsters, such as trampling opponents or throwing boulders. 
</p><p>
 At the end of each wandering monster tier is the ultimate monster of that type. These monsters are so powerful that there can only be one of them in existance at one time.<br/>
