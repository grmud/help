<p>
In the very heart of the Isle of Uthgol, a shrine to the beast that has spawned all others lies, a haven of pacifism in the middle of this blood- and ichor-soaked land. Grendel's Shrine, as it is simplistically called by all the castes, sits in the center of Uthgol. Grendel, the Father of All Monsters, lives in this dark tribute to the evil, wretched, sordid, currently victimized denizens of the Island. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
While feeling general apathy for the state of his domain, Grendel does insist that no violence come within a short distance of his own worshipping area. Monsters are forbidden by a powerful magic to keep from attacking others; the new arrivals are just as bound by this magic to be peaceful inside Grendel's safe zone. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Those monsters who are just beginning their journey through slaughter and blood can find their first grunt at Grendel's own breeding pit, from whence all Monsters Originate. From these humble beginnings, the greatest and most infamous grumbles in Uthgol are made.<br/>
