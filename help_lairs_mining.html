A mine can only be built by a builder with the mining skill. Mines must be built at resource deposits, whether these are found above ground, or under it. Resource deposits of all types are scattered above the surface, as well as underneath it. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Surface mines can only be built within the zone of control of a lair. A lair's zone of control is an invisible radius around the lair, the size of which is determined by the size and power of the clan. Underground mines may be built inside of a lair. You will know that you have discovered a resource deposit underground when you attempt to build a structure in the direction of it. You will receive a message telling you that there is a resource deposit in that direction, and that you can only build a mine there. Only mines can be built in resource deposits. No other structures are permitted. Chimeras who have the vein sniffer role are able to detect the presence and direction of underground resource deposits. To do this, type 'veinsniff &lt;direction&gt;'. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Once a suitable resource deposit has been discovered, a builder with the mining special ability may build a mine. For above ground resource deposits, stand in the same room as the resource deposit, and type 'build mine to the &lt;direction&gt;', where direction leads to a room inside of your clan's zone of control. To build a mine underground, stand in a room adjacent to the resource deposit, and type 'build mine to the &lt;direction&gt;', where direction is the direction of the resource deposit from your current location. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Once a mine has been built, grunts may mine resources from it. To do this, bring a grunt to the mine and type 'command &lt;grunt&gt; to mine'. The grunt will begin to mine resources. When the grunt has finished mining a quantity of resources, the resources will automatically be deposited in your clan's storage chamber. IMPORTANT: You must have a storage chamber for grunts to mine. If you do not have a storage chamber, your grunts will not mine.<br/>
