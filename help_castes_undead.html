 </p><h3>Undead</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 Members of the Undead Caste are characterized by an incredibly strong inner will and a bright, hard, cold flame of determination that keeps their dead bodies animated and moving far beyond what most people can expect at the advent of death. Less generous folk have been known to label this singularity of will as obsession. Members of this caste care little for the opinions of the living, however, and prefer to pursue their own interests, unhampered by such inconveniences as time, age, and death. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Although the more powerful of the undead would never admit to such excess of emotion, all undead hate and envy the living and the bright warmth of the daytime world, things forevermore denied them. There have been a few rare tales of certain types of undead nearly able to pass as human seeking to live among and mingle with humans, but they are considered by their fellow caste members as, at best, odd unnatural creatures, and, at worst, as traitors to be destroyed on sight. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 In appearance, undead are generally horrific, with decomposing, dead flesh, and awful smells. A very few types, such as vampires, can sometimes keep their appearance up with magic--or by the simple nature of what they are-but they still look much less than alive. Appearance is not an important topic for most undead, and all of them enjoy the terrified reaction of the living to their awful visages. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 The undead have a certain respect for death, having passed through it already and, indeed, embodying it in part. Death holds no fear for them and is seen as another phase of existence. The great Grendel is revered as the dimmer of the sun--the bringer of death to the pink-skins and of wealth and knowledge to the undead. Ritual sacrifices of the living bring Grendel's favor and sometimes new soldiers to the Undead caste. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Undead prefer cold, dark, musty places: stone tombs with sarcophagi, burial mounds with reinforced walls, and catacombs far under cities. There they can hide from the unkind light of the sun, perform rituals, and scheme ways to destroy the living. After a successful nighttime attack, they can retreat to these dank lairs in peace with their prizes of loot or even living beings--for there are few living creatures who would dare follow them in.

</p><blockquote><i>"..and such was my need, my will, my desire, that I shrugged off Death's grasp as if it were no more than tendrils of mist wrapping me round, and woke to this new life, this un-life, this blessing that the living call a curse. Now I was free to pursue that one who had fired my wrath--that fool who all unknowing planted in me the seeds of his own destruction. 
</i><p><i>
For I could pursue him relentlessly, night after night, giving him no rest, finding him wherever he hid, tormenting him until, utterly mad, he embraced Death Herself in an effort to escape me. But escape, he did not, for night after night, month after month, _year upon year upon age, he serves me, one of my lowliest minions, never speaking, yet in his eyes is always the knowledge of all he lost to me, and the horror of his immortality."</i>
