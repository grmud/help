 </p><h3>Ogre</h3>
 
<p>
 
</p><p>
 Ogres are large, intimidating creatures with great strength. Other races often make them the butt of jokes about their apparent lack of intelligence and dull wit, and indeed, ogres are not known for their brainpower. But they make up for that lack with steady, deliberate action and relentless, unstoppable force. Monotonous tasks never bore them; they make excellent builders. They are surprisingly quick for their size, and their brute strength makes them soldiers to be feared in any army. Ogres are terribly stubborn and won't give up on a task unless they die at it or are ordered to stop. Single-minded determination is both their blessing and curse. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Many ogres hire out as mercenaries to other races, finding the job easy and rewarding. They are loyal to their employers and do almost anything they are ordered to do. Ogres are very slow to anger, but once their ire has been sparked they are relentless in their quest for vengeance. "Unstoppable as an ogre" and "Stubborn as an ogre" are two common expressions among monster races. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 Ogres have little discernible culture to outside observers, with a rudimentary language and simple pleasures such as battle and food. However, ogres know that they are competitive with one another and once a year gather for mock battles, wrestling matches, and other contests of strength. Woe be to the employer who does not allow his ogre minions to attend these games, for he quickly finds out just how formidable his hirelings are. 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
 In appearance ogres are large, well-muscled creatures with thick skin covered by thick body hair. They have exaggerated facial features with huge noses, thick eyebrows, and large, jutting teeth. They are startlingly graceful in their movements, displaying great strength carefully controlled, and for this reason some of them may also try healing arts.
